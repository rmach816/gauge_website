# Assets Folder

This folder should contain:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px recommended)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image (recommended: 1284x2778px for iOS, 1920x1920px for Android)

## Setup Instructions

1. Create or obtain app icon and splash screen images
2. Place `icon.png` and `splash.png` in this folder
3. The app.json is already configured to use these files

For now, you can use placeholder images or generate them using online tools.
